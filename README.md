This repository is an attempt to organize and make my Master's project available to my collaborators (in an organized way). It's still a work in progress, there is much to be organized before it can be effectively used, but once it does it would be great to only work in these codes through this repository. I'll not track test files, test scripts, data files and I'll also not track the codes I write when I'm learning a new module, library or code in general. I'll also not track bin directories, I'll leave compiling instructions in all main directories though.

All directory paths will be relative paths because I'm assuming everyone who gets access to these codes will maintain the same structure for the repos as the structure created in this repo, which makes everything simpler. In case you need to transfer some of this to a cluster for instance, or if you just downloaded a few of the codes, it's likely you will need to adapt the code to account for this.
