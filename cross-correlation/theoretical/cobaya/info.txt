pyctg.py simply interprets the C++ function to calculate Ctg and translates it into a Python function to be used alongside Cobaya. pyctg_theory.py will contain both theory classes for calculation of Ctg and Cgg, while pyctg_likelihood.py will contain likelihood calculation, while also containing a testing area upon direct execution that can be used as a base for the creation of new Python scripts to create more runs.
