\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.1}{\ignorespaces A representation of the time evolution of the Universe, starting from the left (the Big Bang) with time passing towards the right. The radius of each section indicates the size of the Universe at that time; during inflation this radius increases very rapidly, indicating an accelerated expansion during this period, while closer to the present the slope of increase in size shows a slight acceleration, indicating the current dark energy accelerated period. Briefly after the inflation period (in cosmological time), the photons decouple from baryons, leaving a radiation field in the Universe, resulting in the CMB, represented in the image by the afterglow of inflation. After this, the only radiation in the Universe is this afterglow for many years, during that time structure starts to form from the small inhomogeneities left by quantum fluctuations in the very early stages of the Universe, forming the first stars and then the first galaxies.
